# bees

A "bee hive" game based on the genetic algorithm chapter from [Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com).

Two beehives send out bees to find a flower. They eventually learn to return home after finding the flower. If 1/3 of the bees return home, that hive's population grows by 1. Gotta think about how to let users tweak parameters, or get upgrades, or something to make it more gamish.
